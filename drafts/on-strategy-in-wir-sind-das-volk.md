[Wir Sind Das Volk!](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/165401/wir-sind-das-volk) is a good board game.

These thoughts will not be meaningful without knowledge of the [rules](http://www.histogame.de/WSDV/Wir.sind.das.Volk.Rules.pdf) and perhaps a few games in person, or on [boardgamescore](http://play.boardgamecore.net).

### Language

I will use the values between **-6 and +6** to refer to spot on the prestige, western currency (wc) and socialist track. -6 is the spot on the West side furthest from the middle.

I will also refer to the first half of decade 1 as **D1.0**, the second half of decade 1 as **D1.5** and so on. So D3.5 refers to the second half of decade 3.

### For both sides

#### Choosing card modes

Building is an important action. Building infrastructure is more economy-efficient as it increases economy by 2 while a new factory increases economy by 1. It's important to have a plan on where to build ([west](#Where-to-build-West) | [east](#Where-to-build-East)) to maximise infrastructure while meeting other economic objectives.

Playing a card for the event is often worse than using it to build. It's important to have some kind of exchange rate between different effects and regular build points. For example, although the _1953 Uprising_ has a strong effect, the 4 build is often more valuable in D1.

Add living standard is more efficiently done with 1-value cards, as the shortfall that it bridges could usually be replaced by a build point, which is permanent, which contributes to economy/export factory value and also can be dismantled for future 'remove unrest' actions.

Spending a card to remove unrest is important when removing important mass protests, and it can be important for East in D4. In other cases, it is not efficient.

#### Playing cards from the board

In each half-decade, 7 cards are laid out on the board. Each card has a value to each player, which often different. For example, _1953 Uprising_ is worth at least 4 build points to West and at least 1 build point to East. We can say that the swing value is at least 5 build points. Naively, we can say that we can extract most relative value from the board cards by taking the cards with the highest swing value. However, the values of cards in WSDV are often dynamic depending on board state, tracks, hand cards and other cards on the board. Nevertheless, it's useful to think about the swing value of cards.

#### Playing hand cards

It is generally best to play hand cards when 1 card is left on the board in the first half of each decade (D1.5, D2.5, ...). In every other situation, the opponent gets to take an extra card from the board, which results in them either getting better picks of the cards or them getting to play more cards than us.

The player with priority from prestige can choose how many hand cards to play and the other player must either follow suit or give up the first pick of the second half of the decade, which has the highest swing value. This is a great advantage of having priority. 

The player with priority should play only strong cards from hand. A large advantage can be gained if they have strong hand cards and the opponent is forced to play weak hand cards. If the player with priority has weak hand cards, they can _rush_ the decade by playing no hand cards and the opponent will need to give up some board cards to play his hand cards. 

There are two exceptions to playing strong hand cards at the ends of the first-half-decades. The first is having unrest removal in hand as West in D2 and the board having no mass protest. It is good to save the unrest removal until after East plays unrest cards in D2.5. The second exception is having _Shipyards Crisis_ or _Oil Crisis_ as East. These are often useful to save for late in the decade to play, where the opponent often cannot repair the damage done before the decade ends. 

#### Prestige

The prestige track is of high importance overall, but parts of the track differ in [_temperature_](https://senseis.xmp.net/?TemperatureCGT) (urgency of contesting the track). The middle of the track is the hottest, where it swings between -1 step (towards West) and +1 step (towards East). Between -1 and -4 is the coolest part of the track, as there is relatively little difference between 1 rundown and 1 dismantle + 1 unrest.

Gaining priority is the biggest reward of prestige. During the decade, it means being able to decide how many hand cards to play. If the player with priority plays a hand card at the end of the first half-decade, assuming no hand it means getting the best card in the first half of the decade.
