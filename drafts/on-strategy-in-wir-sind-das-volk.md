[Wir Sind Das Volk!](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/165401/wir-sind-das-volk) is a good board game.

These thoughts will not be meaningful without knowledge of the [rules](http://www.histogame.de/WSDV/Wir.sind.das.Volk.Rules.pdf) and perhaps a few games in person, or on [boardgamescore](http://play.boardgamecore.net).

### Language

I will use the values between **-6 and +6** to refer to spot on the prestige, western currency (wc) and socialist track. -6 is the spot on the West side furthest from the middle.

I will also refer to the first half of decade 1 as **D1.0**, the second half of decade 1 as **D1.5** and so on. So D3.5 refers to the second half of decade 3.

### For both sides

#### Choosing card modes

Building is the most common card mode. Building infrastructure is more economy-efficient as it increases economy by 2 while a new factory increases economy by 1.

Add living standard is more efficiently done with 1-value cards, as the shortfall that it bridges could usually be replaced by a build point, which is permanent, which contributes to economy/export factory value and also can be dismantled for future 'remove unrest' actions.

Spending a card to remove unrest is important when removing important mass protests, and it can be important for East in D4. In other cases, it is not efficient.

#### Playing cards from the board

In each half-decade, 7 cards are laid out on the board. Each card has a value to each player, which often different. For example, _1953 Uprising_ is worth 4 build points to 

#### Playing hand cards

It is costly and generally inadvisable to play hand cards in the first half of each decade (D1.5, D2.5, ...). This is because the opponent gets to take another card from the board.

#### Prestige

The prestige track is of high importance overall, but parts of the track differ in [_temperature_](https://senseis.xmp.net/?TemperatureCGT) (urgency of contesting the track). The middle of the track is the hottest, where it swings between -1 step (towards West) and +1 step (towards East). Between -1 and -4 is the coolest part of the track, as there is relatively little difference between 1 rundown and 1 dismantle + 1 unrest.

Gaining priority is the biggest reward of prestige. During the decade, it means being able to decide how many hand cards to play. If the player with priority plays a hand card at the end of the first half-decade, assuming no hand it means getting the best card in the first half of the decade.
