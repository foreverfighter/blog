These thoughts will not be meaningful without knowledge of the rules and perhaps a few games in person, or on a platform like boardgamescore or boardgamesarena. 

# For both sides

## Playing hand cards

Hand cards should generally not be played before one card is left on the board in the first half of each decade. 

## Prestige

The prestige track is of high importance overall, but parts of the track differ in _temperature_ (importance of contesting). The middle of the track is the hottest, where it swings between -1 step (towards West) and +1 step (towards East). Between -1 and -4 is the coldest part of the track, as there is relatively little difference between 1 rundown and 1 dismantle + 1 unrest. 

Gaining priority is the biggest reward of prestige. During the decade, it means being able to decide how many hand cards to play. If the player with priority plays a hand card at the end of the first half-decade, assuming no hand it means getting the best card in the first half of the decade.
